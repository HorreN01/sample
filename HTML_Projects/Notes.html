<!-- my HTML notes:
- Web is HTML documents and other resources that refer to each other with links.
- HyperText is a text that can have references(such as links) to other documents and resources.
- When I open my browser and write the URL, I request the web page from the server,
- then the server responds with the HTML documents or files.
- I communicate with the server using HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Web Pages are stored on servers
- Server is a computer that  is not fundamentally different from my computer, but it's different.
- Markup is the way I tell the browser how to display the text to do the semantic function.
- Element is consisted of opening tag, closing tag, and the content
- Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, or line breaks
- HTML ignores whitespaces and treats them as a single space
- Self closing tag is called void element or empty element
- The closing tag is optional for li but not optional for the list as a whole
- In other words, a closing tag is optional for each list item, but not for the list as a whole. 
- We must be sure to close the list as a whole! Why? Because if we leave off the closing tag for ul or ol
- then the browser will not know when our list ends! It will simply treat everything that comes after that point as part of the list.
- <p> and <li> are elements with optional closing tags
- the browser will close it by himself when he see a new starting tag after them

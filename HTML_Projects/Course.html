<!-- This file is to elaborate HTML Course

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, so unlike programming languages, It depends on tags not scripts

Tags are the most important things in HTML

Every HTML starts with <html> and ends with </html>

html tag is followed by <head>  (It's the non-visual part)

inside <head> we use <title> and <meta>

<head> is followed by <body>  (It's the visual part)

<body> is so important, it contains the all visual data we will use

inside <body> we use <h1> for heading and <p> for paragraphs
    
Here are some tags for formatting text:
<b>   bold   <strong> is the same
<i>   italic  <em>    is the same (emphasized)
<u>   underline
<small>  smaller
<mark>   mark or highlight
<del>    delete (btshtop L kelma)
<ins>    insert
<sub>    chemical use
<sup>    arithmetic (mathematical ) use
<q>      to make quotation


to add links in the page we use <a> (anchor tag)
<a> has custom attribute which is href
href attribute is for the full path of the link
attributes are written inside the openning tag
the content for <a> will be text that we want to show to the user
<a> can have important attribute which is target
inside target attribute we write "_blank" to open in the link in new tab
third attribute can be used for <a> is title to show something to the user
instead of link, we can put our email like this :
<a href= "mailto: blabla@gmail.com">Contact me</a>
to create a link that lead you to specific paragraph at the same page, do these steps:
1- use id attribute to your paragraph
2- put this id inside href but use # before the id


<img> is the image tag
it has 2 attributes,  src and alt
src is the full path of the source image
alt is the alternative text that will appear if anything is wrong with the image


style attribute is a general attribute it can change the color and background-color of the text


List tags:
<ul>   unordered list       is used to declare that i'm going to use this kind of list
<ol>   ordered   list       is used to declare that i'm going to use this kind of list
<li>   list item that is written inside ul or ol
the attributes we can use with <ol> is reversed and start and type

<dl>  descrpition list      is used to declare that i'm going to use this kind of list
<dt>  description term
<dd>  description of term


<table> to make table
the table consists of 3 things:
table head  <thead>
table body  <tbody>
table foot  <tfoot> (not always)
inside them we put rows  <tr>
inside the row we put <td> which is table data
to sum up:
<thead>   table head
<tbody>   table body
<tfoot>   table foot
<tr>      table row
<td>      table data
<caption> caption for the table
colspan attribute is used to merge rows, we pass value to it like 1 or 2 or 3
rawspan attribute is used to merge columns, we pass value to it like 1 or 2 or 3


<span> is the same as any text without tag but we use it to focus on some text to help us dealing with it in the CSS


<div>  (division or group) it's so important, it's a container to deal with things easily and correctly in the CSS
we use class attribute to distinguish div tags
we don't use <div> with any normal text. we should know the appropriate cases to use


Entities enables us to write tag as a normal text
to do so we use the following snytax:
& following by the entitiy name followed by semi colon
so if we want to wrwit <p> as a text we do like this:
&lt; p &gt;
&lt = less than
&gt = greater than
we can get these entities from the internet


semantic elements are just meaningful elements that were added in HTML5 instead of using many <div> and their classes attributes:
<header>
<nav>  (navigation bar)
<section> or <main> (mo7twa el mawk3)
<article>
<aside>
<footer>


<audio> has attributes like:
src         the full path of the audio
controls    to display the control buttons
autoplay    to autoplay the audio once i open the site
loop        to replay the audio
muted       to mute the audio


<video> has attributes like:
src         the full path of the video
controls    to display the control buttons
autoplay    to autoplay the video once i open the site
loop        to replay the video
muted       to mute the video
width
height
poster      to display temporary img while the video is downloading
<track>     is optional to use for people with disorder, it has attributes like:
src
kind
srclang
label


<form>               inside it we use  <input>
<input>              is a self closing element. It has attributes like: 
type                 text - password - email - submit - reset - hidden - color - range - number - radio - checkbox - date - url
required             is important and cannot be skipped
placeholder          enables me to show something to the user if label does not exist
value                is used to show  the old email to the user (for example)
name
readonly             we can only read it, it will be sent with the data     
disabled             we can do nothing with it, it won't be sent with the data
autofocus            to focus on some input once i open the site
minlength            can be used with password input
maxlength            can be used with passwword input
 
<form> has attributes like : 
action           to send the data to the file i want
method           to choose which method to send it,  get or post
<label>          is used to name our inputs

we can connect between input and its label
to do so, we will give an id to the input
then we will use for attribute in the label tag like this:
label for = "id value"
